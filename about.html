              <p>Welcome to the creative world of Nathan Owen.</p>
              <p>Where time and space are daily thought processes to calculate my past to create a beautiful future.
              From where I came from to where I'm going, below will give you a small hint at who I am.
              Thank you for taking a look at some of my coding projects and ideas for my future business endeavors. </p>

                <h6>Xero-Industries LLC, Crytek Industries LLC</h6>
                <p>How do you reach your goals without a plan right? Well I am already working on getting 'Project Xero' out to the public, followed closely by getting back into personal training and starting another business running a development company. Any other ideas? All recommendations are welcome. </p>
                <p>Xero-Industries coming soon.</p>

                   <p>Practice my coding skills with supreme styling perspectives in mind. I have learned HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, SASS, React, Reactstrap, D3, Axios, Node, Express, and MongoDB. I am working on learning Python and SQL.</p>
                   <p>My goal is to learn Pytorch so I can learn to code Virtual and Augmented Reality in the near future. Watch out for the OASIS, it's coming soon. </p>

                    <h6>Creative writer of the smash 'Project Xero.'</h6>
                    <p>Spent this time focusing more on the person who I wanted to be and in the process I learned a lot about myself and the struggles that we all hide deep within our subconscious. </p>
                    <p>After finishing this very long project I knew that I was destined for much more than I could have ever imagined. Keep Watching. I hope to see you all at the finale. </p>

                   <p>The most rewarding jobs are the ones that don't feel like work at all. Helping individual athletes reach their performance and fitness goals. Helping them walk on stage to compete or dominating the Tough Mudder my athletes never disappoint. I am very well diversified in the movements of the human body and push my athletes to their limits every single session. Highly motivated athletes only need apply.</p>
