                        <p>Hello and welcome to the future of the human condition. My name is Xero and I am here to guide
                            you on your journey with me to the stars and beyond. This is our latest installation here on your
                            planet Earth. Welcome to Project Xero.

                        <h2>Introduction</h2>
                        <p> This is place where you can design and construct your own transhumanistic fantasy. Any metallic 
                            combination with another and selct your conductive harness and color. Leave it to Crypto and in no time.
                            She will have your perfect prototype ready for your transference into the next step of evolution. Where 
                            the human version of you will become a machine. But nothing like you've ever heard of before. Something 
                            of mythical gods and superheroes combined, only to teach humanity the truth of where we came from and where
                            we are going next. Still interested?

                        <h2>New Mainframe</h2>
                        <p>This is where we will give a detailed description of what you can expect from the machine. Should you choose to join the Faction. With each unit based on the material it is created with can have a variety of uses. Such as Jago: my number one
                            created prototype. The material I used to create him was titanium and chromium. I built his harness with gold for cunductivity and black osidium for strength. Overall, this super strong and lightweight material made this prototype extremely flexible 
                            and dense. So once he was fully cloned he was easily programmed to become the fastest and dangerous hand to hand combat fighter I ever thought I could build. Another example is Shadow: A black tungsten carbine frame with matching gold harnessing.
                            Built in the exact specifications as Jago and trained the same came out a little slower but much much stronger in every aspect possible. So from plutonium to platinum, from chromium to copper, every single one of these metallic materials has a specific 
                            use in its build. So what happens when we find other metallic materials in space? New upgrades or all new prototypes? There is no limit to where we can go from here.
                                Mixing the metals over a human working internal functioning brain and muscular structure. This is guaranteed to withstand the tests of time and space. Will you join us?  
                        </p>

                    <section class="contentsections" id="Cellular-Regeneration">
                        <h2>Cellular-Regeneration</h2>
                        <p>This is one of the most exciting parts of what we have become. Tired of seeing your families die off in sad circumstances? Tired of getting sick and missing time off work and missing out on time with family and loved ones?
                            No longer is this an issue with the Project Xero: Protoytype one:1. Your immune system will have infinite possibilities to save itself every day. The human body repairs and replaces every living cell in the body every 7-8 years.
                            With the new Prototype one:1 this exact same cellular process happens every 60 seconds and with that the prototype body has a cellular regeneration so should you choose to hide behind the machine in your human form the machine will not
                            let you show damage of any sorts. Beware: The machine can take any sort of damage that this world can throw at it, but if it does take serious damage the machine will be fine but for several seconds the machine will need time to recreate the 
                            flesh on the outside to keep it disquised. Sound to good? What about never having to worry about your body dying? As a prototype the machine will never die. Ever. So think of the journeys you can live out with that no longer hindering your thought process.
                            Save your loved ones. Save yourself. Save humanity. The choice is yours and the universe is big place to adventure out in to.

                        <h2>Upgradeable-Hardware</h2>
                        <p>Let's say you needed a certain set of skills or a certain set of weaponry for a job or for your mission? You can always exchange prototypes at any hidden location. We here at Project Xero want to see the best come out of this world and the next.
                            So we need you to be sucessful. Need back up or an army? We have you covered. From hitmen and assasins to stealth ninjas. Plutonium war machines? Chromium electrical charges? Exploding machines that immediately regenerate back to themselves? 
                        We've got you covered. We have also made some friends along the way. From Insectoids, Grey aliens, Reptilians, and Black Op Agents. This is a war we intend to win at any cost.
                    In closing I'd like you create an idea for each and everyone of you. Tell me your dreams and goals. I will provide the prototype for you to complete them.</p>

                    <section class="contentsections" id="Man-or-Machine">
                        <h2>Man-or-Machine</h2>
                        <p>Now here is the part where I must distinguish the nature of what we really are. Now if you were sick and dying in a hospital bed. Would it be inhumane to help extend the life of a fellow man, woman, or child?
                            Extending life as we know it is usually justified in several different aspects of what our past has tried to teach us of ourselves and our creators. To that I humbly choose to disagree. If we are created in the 
                            likeness of any type of diety. Then why all the hurt and pain of the past, the horrible plagues and diseases such as cancer, failing internal organs, or perhaps never being born with all the human characteristics?
                            If you believe that we are playing god,perhaps you are right. But don't you want to see what life would be like in an advanced lifeform that is not only faster, stronger, and could possibly live forever, but be one 
                            step closer to finding out where we really came from? Creation or evolution? Ancient aliens or panspermia? I promise to introduce you to the Energy-Beings that showed me this technology and let you make your decision from there.
                            One way or the other we are not fully machine or all human anymore. Remember you can always return to your natural human body at any time. Which will be placed in cryostasis and stored in our heavily guarded unknown facility.

                        <h2>Ultimate-Abilities</h2>
                        <p>This is my favorite part of transhumanism. With each upgrade orb you locate on planet Earth you will unlock unnatural abilities that will take the internal machine to the next step in its power process. Thus the list of things that you 
                            always wanted to do as a youngling are all possibilities now. Thanks to the power unlocked in the small metallic spheres. Ever want to fly? Actively disappear in any place at any time? How about wanting to see the other end of the world 
                        at that exact same moment? Teleporting may help you achieve that goal. Tired of wondering about money? Controling the financial institutions monetary system  and how they are spent are available as well? Ran up on by several rough looking characters
                    at once and don't know if you can defend yourself? How about 100 of you? Change aspects of things a little? Now there are some supremely high level attributes that I can only show you upon face to face interviews. But let your imagination take you to the clouds
                and I guarantee I have an ability that will get you to think twice about your human existance </p>

                    <section class="contentsections" id="Goals">
                        <h2>Goals</h2>
                        <p>As I mentioned earlier in the Man or Machine section of this page. I was given dreams from what I can only describe as the ultimate Energy-Beings that showed me where my facility is located and taught me the technology therein. They sent me on the ultimate 
                            mission of learning to perfect myself. Once I completed that my next mission is this. To help out mankind to its next level in what we call its evolutionary state of growth to an ultimate crossbreed between human and machine prototype. I now have a faction that is 
                            200 plus members strong. Since we are not completely out in the open just yet, we all have our own hidden human lives and continue to live amongst you in secret. From scientist in the government, A couple of my buddies are in a huge band that I will mention later on.
                            As well as a successful business icon. Once I feel that our faction is as large as we need we will leave this planet and head to the stars to meet with our Energy Beings where they will show us where we originally came from and how to get back there. Sound to crazy for reality?
                            Well I believe that this will not be the case for most people looking for a cause, looking for hope, and tired of being treated as a tool or a slave. My faction is not a group of not narrow minded slaves but all share a inner knowledge of who they are internally. We focus so much more 
                            on the internal Energy that is not described in theological approaches. Once you are one with the machine. The internal Energy calls to you in ways I can never describe, but show you first hand. Think it through.
